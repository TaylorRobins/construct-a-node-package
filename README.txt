Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another?
A npm package is a node module or multiple modules in a single library.

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?

node.js allows you to export your newly created modules for the community to use.
